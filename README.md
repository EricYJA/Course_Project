# Course_Project

Note that this repo kept my Course work which are projects. I finished these projects in CUHK(SZ) and UC Berkeley. The projects are all team work. 

## MyVCS

A vision control system, implemented by 4 people start from scrach. I am in charge of the different commands, especially merge operation.



## Pencil

A picture editing software. Try the release if you want. Note that most of the operation are based on OpenCV. Thus, follow the report provided in the release version to set up.  This is also a start-from-scrach team project. I am in charge of implementing features like zoom, crop, rotate, keyboard capture and a little style transfer algorithm design. 



## UCB_Maps

A map, basically. I am in charge of the design and implement of K-D tree and "binary" search in K-D tree. My partner is in charge of finding the root using A*.  We finished the rest of the project together.
